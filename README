Script for taking a picture from the Raspberry Pi camera when a switch is 
active and then uploading it to a server.  Handy for a makerspace web cam.

Start by creating an SSH key with:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f upload_key.rsa

Don't set a passphrase on this key.

Create a user on your server and give it write access to the specific path on 
the webserver for the feed picture.  Add the key above to this user's 
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.  In this file, you can limit what the key is 
allowed to do by setting some comma-delimited options before the key:

    no-port-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa AAAA...

Fill in the relevant configuration constants in the script for SERVER_USERNAME, 
SERVER_HOST, and SERVER_UPLOAD_PATH.  You'll also want to set FLIP_IMAGE to 1 if 
your camera module is mounted upside-down, and 0 otherwise.

Finally, set the script to run on your Pi by adding it to /etc/rc.local:

    /path/to/bodgery_open_cam_daemon.pl &

This will let it run every time your Pi reboots.
